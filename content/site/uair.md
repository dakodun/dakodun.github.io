      <a href='https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/uair#Scottish_Gaelic'>Uair</a> is the
      working title of a game framework that I've been developing on and off for a
      while as a means to learn and experiment with different technologies and techniques.
      It is available under the permissive <a href='https://opensource.org/licenses/Zlib'>zlib licence</a>
      so have at it.
