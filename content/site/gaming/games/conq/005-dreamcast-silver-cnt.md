A really fun action RPG that's enjoyable to play and is filled
with a ton of cool pre-rendered backgrounds, though I wish there
was more interaction with them (just fluff like describing the
books on the shelves or the smell of the vials on the desk).

The companion AI can be a little dense at times — requiring some
micro-management to get them into the fight proper — but not to the
point it detracts from the experience.

I've attached screenshots of some of my favourite screens.
