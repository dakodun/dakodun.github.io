I've started the original Metroid a few times but never managed to see it
all the way through (I never played it back in the day so don't have the
nostalgia to help me through); this is a re-telling of the original story
with modern features and conveniences, plus some extra content.

I finished the game with 100% on normal mode (hard mode was locked) and I
could see myself replaying again to 100% hard mode, or maybe even try a
low% run (I don't see myself trying any of the time based endings though).

There's even an unlockable version of the original for me to give it
another go.
