I found this one on a list of lesser known SNES games worth playing
(it never had a PAL release). I'd describe it as a [Breakout][breakout]
RPG in a fantasy setting, which I find to be a very interesting mix.

The game is relatively short and definitely leaves room to explore the
concept further. There are also cooperative and competitive multiplayer
modes but I haven't tried those.
