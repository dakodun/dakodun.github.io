Had never heard of this one but saw it in some old N64 magazines. Claimed
to be Metal Gear Solid for N64 but that's misleading; it has a more
arcadey presentation and none of the story or characterisation. Still
a fun playthrough (once you get past the early 3D controls).

I played on hard which was a good challenge, and I later discovered
that I got the middle-of-the-road ending due to taking my sweet time.
