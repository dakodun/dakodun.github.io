This was my first time playing any version of Code Veronica and I think
it might now be my favourite Resident Evil. I liked being able to see
my health status on the VMU instead of always having to check the
inventory screen.

I know from experience what sort of things affect your final rank but
I didn't want to rush through the game, or skip saves and risk having
to repeat large sections of the game on my first playthrough; I did
make an effort not to use any First Aid Sprays though.

_I also left the game paused at times which didn't pause the timer, and
I didn't know it was counting the retries otherwise I would've just
reloaded the save (only twice did the retry actually benefit me:
when first switching back to Claire and right before the final boss)._
