  `"**Consoles**" is a list of all my
    retro consoles and handhelds that I've restored, fixed and modded
    (I still have all the original parts and 99% of the modifications
    are reversible) and projects that are currently ongoing or are
    earmarked for the future.`
  `"**Beaten Games**" is a list of the
    games I've beaten on said hardware since I started keeping track,
    alongside any media and notes relevant. I've beat some of these
    many times before, some I've played in the past but never finished
    and others I hadn't even heard of at all.` >}}
