I never had a Game Boy of my own until I found this
*Big Boy* lying discarded like yesterday's jam, by which
time the Game Boy Advance was already establishing itself. It
was a little battered and worn — and was missing it's battery
cover naturally — but otherwise worked just fine and gave me
hours of fun playing a copy of Pokémon Gold that I also found 
abandoned a little while later.

*As an aside: Pokémon Gold released later in Europe,
and this copy had no sticker and couldn't hold a save. I
somehow managed to replace the battery without any of the
right tools or know-how though, and despite the fun-poking
from my friends about my not-so-much-choice of hardware, we
had a blast playing some second-generation Pokémon together
(though if things ever did get too heated I fancied my chances
in a "Game Boy to the Head" competition).*

- New IPS screen
  - I like the
  original screen on the Game Boy — and it was in decent
  condition, once I fixed the vertical lines — but my days
  of playing whilst hanging off the back of the couch in
  order to catch enough light to see the low contrast screen
  are behind me.
  - I considered backlighting the original screen
    but I didn't want to modify it in such a way.
- New screen lens, shell, buttons and rubbers
  - The original plastic screen looked like it had lost a
    fight with a thousand cats at the same time, and the shell
    had that old plastic-yellow chic, so I replaced both. The
    screen is glass which feels a lot better tactilely and
    should put up a better fight against any felines that
    challenge it.
  - Style wise, I opted to mimic the original colours as close
    as I could. The new shell never had the Nintendo lettering
    (for legal reasons) so I added a nice embossed metallic
    sticker to the front, and a new serial sticker (with the
    original serial number) on the back. The shell also came
    with a new link port cover, which is something I never
    knew even existed on the original.
- Rechargable (USB-C) LiPo battery and power regulator
  - The new IPS screen draws more power than the original so
    to help deal with this I added a LiPo battery.
    I also added a power regulator to reduce noise and improve
    stability (how effective this was I don't know but it's in
    there now). It's also much more convenient to recharge due
    to an abundance of USB-C charging cables lying around;
    something I don't even have to do too often.
- Cleaned the insides and removed a little corrosion

I tried a new speaker but found no real difference from the
original so decided to stick with that. I also installed an
amplifier but found it increased the noise too much and I
find the Game Boy plenty loud enough as it is, always choosing
to play with the volume lowered anyway so I removed it.
