This is my GBA SP that I got for my birthday around the end of 2004.
Originally sporting the 'Tribal' design; a design which divides opinion
(pretty heavily to one side) though I'm not overly bothered by it. It was
the only version that was on display for sale at the time anyway. That
being said, if I had a choice of all available designs, I probably
wouldn't have gone with it.

I never had a lot of games for it but I did have Final Fantasy Tactics
Advance and Fire Emblem, both of which packed on a lot of hours.

- New IPS screen
  - Intially, I was going to stick with the original front-lit screen.
  Then someone mentioned how it gives everything a bluish tint and I
  couldn't see past it so decided on a swap.
  - I already had a spare backlit screen that I wasn't using but it
  would require me to cut the supports on the shell to fit it (which
  I've had to do before but didn't want to do with this shell). Instead,
  I opted for a new IPS which is sized to the dimensions of the original
  and drops right in.
- New shell, buttons and battery
  - I found this super cool, purple-n-white Donkey Kong® shell which
  I paired with some matching white buttons (except the backlight
  toggle which I left grey). I also stuck a new battery in as the
  original was getting long in the tooth (or short in the charge
  bladder).
- New trigger switches and power switch
  - One of the shoulder buttons was misbehaving prompting me to swap
  both switches out for fresh new ones (these give a click when depressed
  as opposed to the OEM switches which have a spongier feel — I'm still
  not sure which I prefer).
  - The power switch had also seized up and in trying to _gently_ loosen
  it the plastic nub snapped off, so I had to remove and replace that too
  (not for the first time either, but hopefully for the last).

In the future, I'd like to swap the grey backlight button out for a
matching purple one so that it better blends in (which is the effect I
was going for). I'd also like swap the rubber screw covers (by the
screen) for opaque purple ones as the current set are slightly
transparent and a shade too bright which makes them stand out,
especially when light hits them.
