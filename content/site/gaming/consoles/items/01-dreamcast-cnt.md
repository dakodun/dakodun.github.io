Whenever I'd be reading a general gaming magazine (like
GamesMaster) and came across something about the Dreamcast I
always thought it looked *so cool*; even years later when
watching retrospective videos on Youtube or reading articles.
I'd never even seen one in person though, or knew anyone that
has or had one back in the day, so when I was looking to add
to my collection and decided I was going Sega it had to be a
Dreamcast.

- Fuse, CMOS battery and power LED.
  - The fuse on the controller PCB had blown (which
  apparently is quite common and can be caused by
  hot-plugging controllers) so I soldered in a new
  resettable one. The rechargeable CMOS battery had also
  completely drained and no longer held a charge. I decided
  to swap it for a battery holder (in case I ever needed to
  change it again) and popped a new one in there.
  - I also opted to replace the orange power LED with a blue
  one as the European dreamcast logo is blue and I wanted to
  match them up; I'm really pleased with how good they look
  together.
- ODE
  - While I still enjoy the tactile experience of popping an
  honest-to-goodness official Sega approved GD-ROM disc
  into the console and spinning it up to play my games,
  the rarity and cost of a lot of the Dreamcast library's
  better offerings makes it prohibitive and I'd rather
  those stay squirelled away safely in their boxes.
  Replacing the GDROM drive with an optical drive emulator
  lets me do just that and it's also handy for those pesky
  region exclusives I'd otherwise never get to play.
- Power
  - The internal power supply module was working fine but
  was nearly 25 years old so I replaced it with a
  (genuine) PicoPSU. With the disk drive now also absent
  the Dreamcast should run cooler (and safer).
- Cleaned inside and out
  - Visually the Dreamcast was in great condition. All it
  needed was to be stripped down and gently cleaned; I
  really like the original styling of the machine and
  decided to stick with it.

I was going to replace the fan but the version in my Dreamcast
is a metal fan mounted to the baseplate which would require
cutting to fit the new one which I wasn't willing to do;
Instead I opted to clean and re-lubricate the existing fan.
