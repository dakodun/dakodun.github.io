This is my childhood PS2 which I got for Christmas a
couple of years after release, so around 2002. I played the
pants off this guy until he was put away several years later,
on Christmas 2006, when I moved on to the 7th generation of home
consoles (he did resurface from time to time, mostly to play
Romance of the Three Kingdoms VIII).

- Network Adapter (w/ SATA Mod) and HDD
  -  Upon powering up for the first time in an age, I found the
  disk drive wasn't reading disks and sounded a bit grumpy. I
  decided I wanted to install a hard disk drive to protect both it
  and my original disks.
  - Originally I went with an aftermarket network adapter as
  it was more readily available and seemed like it would be a lot
  less work (and money) to get working. Unfortunately (unbeknownst
  to me at the time) some of the pins in the adapter bent when it
  was inserted and must have caused a short which (thankfully) only
  popped 2 fuses.
  - After replacing the fuses, I opted for an official network adapter
  modded with a SATA upgrade. I never had much interest in the network
  conectivity initially (which isn't available on the aftermarket
  adapters) but now I'm very glad to have it. While the transfer
  speeds are not quick — if you're looking to transfer a lot of large
  files at once you'd be better off connecting the HDD directly —
  the utility of not having to disconnect everything to hook it up
  to a PC each time is incredibly convenient; you can even backup
  and restore memory cards quickly and easily. *(I also don't like
  the idea of removing and inserting the adapter over and over as
  there is slight damage on the port, possibly from the aftermarket
  adapter.)*
- Power Supply
  - I swapped the PSU out for a RePS2 which offloads most of the
  work to a good quality, external and modern AC/DC adapter.
- Big ol' clean
  - When I (eventually) popped open the case for the first time
  the inside was triple-coated in a _generous_ layer of
  dust, especially around the vents and fans.
  - Since I already had it apart I also disassembled the disk drive
  for a proper clean, then re-greased the rails and gears which brought
  it back to life.

This model of PS2 has a thin ribbon cable attached to the power and eject
buttons (which are attached to the top half of the case), ducking,
diving, and dodging until it attaches to a connector
on the main board (which is attached to the bottom half of the
case). It was an _absolute delight_ dealing with this every time I
had to re-open the console, and eventually it had snagged enough
to tear very slightly at one end.

Before resorting to hunting down a suitable replacement I wanted to
attempt a fix: I carefully scratched off the insulating layer just
below the tear, exposing the traces underneath. I then trimmed
just above those, creating a nice straight edge. Finally, I transferred
the hard, blue, plastic backing from the off-cut to the new end and
carefully pushed it back into the connector (after testing for
continuity between each end of the cable with a multimeter).

Thankfully everything is working perfectly again but I would be
very hesitant to ever remove it, or even re-open the shell
(especially as the cable is now shorter than it was).
