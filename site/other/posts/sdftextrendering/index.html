in multi-channel signed distance fields and their efficacy.</p></div><h2 id=introduction>Introduction</h2><p>When it comes to rendering text in OpenGL there are a few traditional
methods that I know of:</p><p>1. The first and perhaps the simplest is to use your font engine (such as
<a href=http://www.freetype.org/ title="The FreeType Project">FreeType</a>) to render your string out to a texture using your desired
font, at your desired size. This is relatively trivial, produces nice
looking results and only requires one textured quad to render. The biggest
drawback of this method is the lack of flexibility; if you want to update
the string &ndash; even slightly &ndash; you generally have to re-render it. This
includes changing the positioning, spacing or other aspect of the
individual glyphs. Furthermore, if you have a lot of text then you&rsquo;ll have
a lot of textures and especially long strings might need textures to be
upsized a lot (to be a valid power of 2).</p><div class=thumbbar style=--thumb-width:512px;--thumb-height:32px><div class=thumbs><a class="thumb lazyload" href=/site/other/posts/sdftextrendering/traditional-1.png style="--lazybg:url('/site/other/posts/sdftextrendering/traditional-1.png');--lazycol:#85888B93" alt='The text "Greetings from the Red

    texture'></a></div><hr><div class=thumblabel><div></div><div>An example of what a string rendered directly to a texture
might look like in memory.</div><div></div></div></div><p>2. The second technique gets around the limitations of the first by instead
rendering each glyph into a texture atlas. Rendering a string is then done
using multiple textured quads, each representing a single glyph. This means
that you can render many strings using the same texture (which reduces bind
and potentially draw calls) and change strings dynamically simply by
removing, replacing or adding more quads. This method introduces a little
more complexity as you have to deal with texture coordinates and quad
positioning as well as font metrics (like kerning). It&rsquo;s also difficult to
render many strings at varying sizes using this method as re-scaling the
texture often results in aliased or blurry text thus requiring another atlas
to be rendered for the new size; eventually this all adds up.</p><div class=thumbbar style=--thumb-width:128px;--thumb-height:128px><div class=thumbs><a class="thumb lazyload" href=/site/other/posts/sdftextrendering/traditional-2.png style="--lazybg:url('/site/other/posts/sdftextrendering/traditional-2.png');--lazycol:#85888B93" alt="Uppercase letters of the
    alphabet arranged in a grid, packed tightly"></a></div><hr><div class=thumblabel><div></div><div>An example of what a simple font atlas might look like.</div><div></div></div></div><p>3. The final method is to forgo texturing altogether and instead render
the individual glyph using vertices. This method adds quite a bit more
complexity overhead to both implementation and rendering. You have to read
the glyphs outline from the font file (freetype makes this fairly trivial)
and also convert and scale the metrics. Many characters (strongly
dependant on the font) are not simple, convex shapes and so rendering
requires proper triangulation. There is also a cost in rendering many
vertices (more vertices mean a higher resolution, especially on curves)
instead of a simple quad (just four vertices). The upside to this method
is freedom from constraints resulting from using bitmaps, the primary of
which being the ability to resize glyphs without much loss of detail.</p><div class=thumbbar style=--thumb-width:1724px;--thumb-height:131px><div class=thumbs><a class="thumb lazyload" href=/site/other/posts/sdftextrendering/traditional-3.png style="--lazybg:url('/site/other/posts/sdftextrendering/traditional-3.png');--lazycol:#85888B93" alt='The text "Greetings from the Red
    Planet" drawn using a series of connected points.'></a></div><hr><div class=thumblabel><div></div><div>An example of what a string rendered as vertices (at a low
resolution) might look like.</div><div></div></div></div><p>A fourth technique exists that uses a font atlas much like the second
method, but adds an additional step that processes the bitmap into what is
known as a signed distance field (it is possible to generate an SDF
without a bitmap input though it tends to be a little more complicated).
The most cited paper that discusses this technique is
<a href=https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/apps/valve/2007/SIGGRAPH2007_AlphaTestedMagnification.pdf title="Improved Alpha-Tested Magnification for Vector Textures and Special Effects">this paper</a> by Valve Software&rsquo;s Chris Green. A signed distance
field in this context is relatively easy to explain: imagine a bitmap as a
grid of pixels with each pixel being either white or black. Anything that
is white is considered outside whilst anything that is black is deemed to
be inside. The pixels are then given a distance value that denotes how
near they are to the boundary (i.e., to a pixel of the opposing colour)
with anything inside having a negative value and anything outside being
positive. This is the basis of a signed distance field.</p><div class=thumbbar style=--thumb-width:376px;--thumb-height:376px><div class=thumbs><a class="thumb lazyload" href=/site/other/posts/sdftextrendering/sdf-define.png style="--lazybg:url('/site/other/posts/sdftextrendering/sdf-define.png');--lazycol:#85888B93" alt></a></div><hr><div class=thumblabel><div></div><div>A representation of a simple signed distance field constructed
using Pythagoras&rsquo; theorem (note that white pixels on the border &ndash; with a

0).</div><div></div></div></div><h2 id=implementation>Implementation</h2><p>There are many ways to calculate the SDF we require: you can use a brute
force approach (as described in the Valve paper), an algorithm like
<a href=https://web.archive.org/web/20131018140807/http://www.ee.bgu.ac.il/~dinstein/stip2002/LeymarieLevineDistTrans_cvgip92.pdf title="Wayback Machine - A Note on Fast Raster Scan Distance Propagation on the Discrete Rectangular Lattice">8SSEDT</a>, or directly using the vector data of the glyph. For my needs
I required something reasonably fast and relatively simple, so I opted to
cheat and instead use the vector data to render a gradient. The first step
was to retrieve the data from the font file which was made simple using
freetype. The vector data is a collection of contours, each comprising of
vertices and bezier curves which match up well with my own framework so it
required very little effort. Afterwards &ndash; using the
<a href=https://github.com/AngusJohnson/Clipper2 title="Clipper2 - A Polygon Clipping and Offsetting library">Clipper library</a> &ndash; it&rsquo;s just a case of offsetting
the contours inwards and outwards, colouring the inner contour black and
the outer white and then rendering&mldr; at least, that&rsquo;s the idea. The
problem is that the results won&rsquo;t be correct if your triangulation doesn&rsquo;t
account for what you&rsquo;re trying to do, most noticeably at corners or curves
where all three vertices of the triangle lie on one contour. Since I
wasn&rsquo;t willing to modify my triangulation to ensure this was never the
case, I tried to cheat even further and instead render the glyph multiple
times with each successive render being offset by a small amount (this was
done with a single draw call). The resulting SDF texture appeared fine at
first glance, but small artefacts became very pronounced when actually
rendered. After unsuccessfully tweaking offsetting values and texture
parameters I went looking for an alternative. After much searching I came
across mention of another algorithm for rendering signed distance fields:
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200502232149/http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.102.7988&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf" title='Wayback Machine - The "dead reckoning" signed distance transform'>Dead Reckoning</a>.</p><p>The input to our function is the texture data as returned by OpenGL (via
glGetTexImage). Using this data we construct a binary map: essentially a
texture where each pixel is either on (true) or off (false). We then use
this binary map to initialise our distance field and border point maps.
These too are similar to our initial texture except each &lsquo;pixel&rsquo; contains
distance values and the coordinates of the nearest border point
respectively. We initialise these to either 0 and self (that is, the
coordinates of the point we are checking) if the current point is a border
point, or to a maximum and the invalid point (-1, -1) if not. After that&rsquo;s
done it&rsquo;s onto the actual process of creating the signed distance field.
From my limited understanding how Dead Reckoning does this is in two
passes; first it propagates the distance values over one corner (for
example left, left-down, down and down-right would be considered a corner)
and then in the second pass propagates over the other corner.</p><div class=codebox><div class=codes><pre><code>if (distanceField[x + dx, y + dy] + distance < distanceField[x, y]) {
  borderPointMap[x, y] = borderPointMap[x + dx, y + dy];

  float distx = x - borderPointMap[x, y].x;
  float disty = y - borderPointMap[x, y].y;
  
  distanceField[x, y] = sqrt((distx * distx) + (disty * disty));
}
</code></pre></div><hr><div class=codelabel><div></div><div>The propagation function that is called eight times per pixel
over two passes (four in each). <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> are the
coordinates of the current point and <code>dx</code> and <code>dy</code>
are the offset to the point we&rsquo;re checking which would be (-1, -1), (0, -1),
(1, -1) and (-1, 0) in the first pass.</div><div></div></div></div><p>After both passes complete the final step is to normalise the data to be
in a format suitable to use in our texture. Firstly we must iterate over
our distance field and check each pixel against its counterpart in the
binary map; if the pixel is outside (a value of false in the binary map)
then we negate the distance value. Afterwards, we scale the distance field
values to be between 0 and 255 and this gives us our SDF texture data. The
last thing to take care of is the shader that interpolates our SDF data
and renders it as a nice crisp glyph. I tried many different shaders —
each doing a similar thing but via a slightly different method — but
settled on a version of one by <a href=https://github.com/paulhoux/Cinder-Samples/tree/master/TextRendering title="Text Rendering using Signed Distance Fields">Paul Houx</a>.</p><div class=codebox><div class=codes><pre><code>float mask = texture(fragBaseTex, fragTexCoord).r;

float edgeWidth = clamp(smoothing * (abs(dFdx(fragTexCoord.x)) +
  abs(dFdy(fragTexCoord.y))), 0.0f, 0.5f);
float alpha = smoothstep(0.5f - edgeWidth, 0.5f + edgeWidth, mask);

finalColour = vec4(fragColour.x, fragColour.y, fragColour.z, alpha);
</code></pre></div><hr><div class=codelabel><div></div><div>The shader used to render our SDF texture. We start by getting
the distance value from the texture (from the red channel) and then
calculate the edge width: the range over which we will interpolate the edges
of the glyph; <code>smoothness</code> determines how soft the edges will be
and can be set as a constant or calculated from the glyph size. Finally, we
get the alpha value using the smoothstep function and set the fragment&rsquo;s
output colour.</div><div></div></div></div><p>When examining the results I noticed there was considerable &lsquo;wiggle&rsquo; on
non axis-aligned edges which shouldn&rsquo;t be the case, and examining the
final texture closer it was possible to see the lack of sufficient detail
to prevent this meaning further steps were required. The first step was to
downscale the SDF by sampling a group of pixels and finding the mean
distance value (to account for this I increased the resolution of the
input); then it was a case of scaling the distance values to be between a
normalised factor which can be done using the formula: <code>scaledDistance = std::max(-normalFactor, std::min(distance, normalFactor)) / normalFactor</code>.</p><div class=codebox><div class=codes><pre><code>for (size_t y = 0u; y < textureHeight; y += scale) {

      for (size_t dx = 0u; dx < scale; ++dx) {
        accum += distanceField[x + dx, y + dy];
      }
    }

    distanceFieldScaled.push_back(accum / (scale * scale));
  }

extra credit: our SDF generation is relatively fast but it wouldn&rsquo;t be
efficient to generate our signed distance texture every time, especially
if we have many glyphs. By implementing a simple caching process we can
create a file that holds all the required information that can be loaded
quickly, even allowing new glyphs to be appended when needed. There are
also some fancy effects we can apply to our text using our shader such as
drop shadows and outlines. To see what that might look like &ndash; as well as
the actual full implementation of the whole process &ndash; check out my
