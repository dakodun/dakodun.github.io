The aim
was to create a web-based game loosely relating to one or more
selected Git terms. I created the game and engine from scratch
for the event, opting to use HTML5 and Javascript as I hadn&rsquo;t yet
had the chance to play around with Canvas. The git terms I focused
on were &lsquo;pushing&rsquo; and pulling&rsquo;.</p><p>The game plays out like a traditional turn-based strategy would,
except that your units are split into two specifications: expendable
and replaceable worker units, and expensive, stationary artillery
units. The worker units exist to scout out ahead through the
fog-of-war — often resulting in their deaths — and to maneuver your
artillery units into offensive positions via pushing and pulling
them. Your artillery units are the only offence you have and once
they are lost the game is over. To win you must reach and destroy
the enemy base.</p><h2 id=map-generation>Map Generation</h2><p>The maps are created procedurally using a (variable) number of
&lsquo;ants&rsquo; which &lsquo;burrow&rsquo; a path from one end to the other. The ants
have a quota of left and right movements that they must fulfil
before moving up one, and bounds on how far left or right they
can move. These horizontal movements are randomised along with
the ant&rsquo;s starting position. This method ensures that there will
always be a path connecting the bottom of the map to the top and
as a result all maps will be valid. In addition to this, both the
size of the bases (the player&rsquo;s landing zone and enemies base,
the former of which will always be smaller in comparison to the
latter) and the size of the map is variable.</p><div class=thumbbar style=--thumb-width:183px;--thumb-height:91px><div class=thumbs><a class="thumb lazyload" href=/site/other/projects/gameoff2012/ssmapgen1.png style="--lazybg:url('/site/other/projects/gameoff2012/ssmapgen1.png');--lazycol:#85888B93" alt></a></div><hr><div class=thumblabel><div></div><div>The &lsquo;Ant&rsquo; wiggles left and right randomly from its
starting position (the circle) until it reaches its wiggle quota, n, and
then it moves up to the next row from its current position (the dotted
line). The Ant cant move more than x spaces from its starting position
in either direction (denoted by the red half blocks) and when it reaches
this boundary it moves in the opposite direction. The spaces visited by
the Ant are valid terrain (green squares) and any not visited are
impassable terrain (black squares).</div><div></div></div></div><p>Originally I planned to use a set of circles to create the map
by placing points at distances along the map (with some random
variance) and then expanding the radii of the circles together
until they collide with one another. This ensures that there is
a valid path from one end of the map to the other. However, because
the maps have a constrained width this led to the map essentially
being a solid block except for one or two missing tiles.</p><div class=thumbbar style=--thumb-width:211px;--thumb-height:158px><div class=thumbs><a class="thumb lazyload" href=/site/other/projects/gameoff2012/ssmapgen2.png style="--lazybg:url('/site/other/projects/gameoff2012/ssmapgen2.png');--lazycol:#85888B93" alt></a></div><hr><div class=thumblabel><div></div><div>Small circles that fit entirely inside one space (black
circles) are seeded throughout the map at set distances apart (with some
random variation) and grow their radii in turn by a size of one space (the
dotted line) until they collide with each other. Every circle must collide
with at least 2 others or with a map boundary (top or bottom). Any spaces
inside the resulting circles (red circles) are considered valid terrain
(green squares) and any outwith are impassable (black squares).</div><div></div></div></div><h2 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h2><p>Due to time constraints (a lot of the time was spent working on
the actual engine) there are a lot of planned features that didn&rsquo;t
make it in. Things such as mobile enemy offensive units that patrol
or seek you out, enemy camps — essentially smaller versions of the
enemy base — which act as blockades to be avoided or destroyed, a
variety of player units to control, and some sort of resource or base
management. On the engine side of things I would have liked to have
audio support (both music and sound effects).</p></div></div></div><footer class=footer><div id=footer-large>Site and content created by Iain Crawford
