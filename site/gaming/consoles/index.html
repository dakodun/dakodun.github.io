<label for=gameboy class=expand-label></label></div><div class=content-header>GAMEBOY</div><div class=content-detail><p>I never had a Game Boy of my own until I found this
<em>Big Boy</em> lying discarded like yesterday&rsquo;s jam, by which
time the Game Boy Advance was already establishing itself. It
was a little battered and worn — and was missing it&rsquo;s battery
cover naturally — but otherwise worked just fine and gave me
hours of fun playing a copy of Pokémon Gold that I also found
abandoned a little while later.</p><p><em>As an aside: Pokémon Gold released later in Europe,
and this copy had no sticker and couldn&rsquo;t hold a save. I
somehow managed to replace the battery without any of the
right tools or know-how though, and despite the fun-poking
from my friends about my not-so-much-choice of hardware, we
had a blast playing some second-generation Pokémon together
(though if things ever did get too heated I fancied my chances
in a &ldquo;Game Boy to the Head&rdquo; competition).</em></p><hr><ul><li>New IPS screen<ul><li>I like the
original screen on the Game Boy — and it was in decent
condition, once I fixed the vertical lines — but my days
of playing whilst hanging off the back of the couch in
order to catch enough light to see the low contrast screen
are behind me.</li><li>I considered backlighting the original screen
but I didn&rsquo;t want to modify it in such a way.</li></ul></li><li>New screen lens, shell, buttons and rubbers<ul><li>The original plastic screen looked like it had lost a
fight with a thousand cats at the same time, and the shell
had that old plastic-yellow chic, so I replaced both. The
screen is glass which feels a lot better tactilely and
should put up a better fight against any felines that
challenge it.</li><li>Style wise, I opted to mimic the original colours as close
as I could. The new shell never had the Nintendo lettering
(for legal reasons) so I added a nice embossed metallic
sticker to the front, and a new serial sticker (with the
original serial number) on the back. The shell also came
with a new link port cover, which is something I never
knew even existed on the original.</li></ul></li><li>Rechargable (USB-C) LiPo battery and power regulator<ul><li>The new IPS screen draws more power than the original so
to help deal with this I added a LiPo battery.
I also added a power regulator to reduce noise and improve
stability (how effective this was I don&rsquo;t know but it&rsquo;s in
there now). It&rsquo;s also much more convenient to recharge due
to an abundance of USB-C charging cables lying around;
something I don&rsquo;t even have to do too often.</li></ul></li><li>Cleaned the insides and removed a little corrosion</li></ul><hr><p>I tried a new speaker but found no real difference from the
original so decided to stick with that. I also installed an
amplifier but found it increased the noise too much and I
find the Game Boy plenty loud enough as it is, always choosing
to play with the volume lowered anyway so I removed it.</p><div class=detail-thumbbar><a href=/site/gaming/consoles/items/photos/gb-front.jpg target=_blank class="thumbbar-thumb lazyload" style="--lazybg:url('/site/gaming/consoles/items/photos/thumbs/gb-front-thumb.png');--lazycol:#99AAAA55"></a><a href=/site/gaming/consoles/items/photos/gb-back.jpg target=_blank class="thumbbar-thumb lazyload" style="--lazybg:url('/site/gaming/consoles/items/photos/thumbs/gb-back-thumb.png');--lazycol:#99AAAA55"></a><a href=/site/gaming/consoles/items/photos/gb-screen.jpg target=_blank class="thumbbar-thumb lazyload" style="--lazybg:url('/site/gaming/consoles/items/photos/thumbs/gb-screen-thumb.png');--lazycol:#99AAAA55"></a><a href=/site/gaming/consoles/items/photos/gb-screen-green2.jpg target=_blank class="thumbbar-thumb lazyload" style="--lazybg:url('/site/gaming/consoles/items/photos/thumbs/gb-screen-green2-thumb.png');--lazycol:#99AAAA55"></a></div></div></div></div><div class=list-item><div class=item-icon><div class=icon-box-top></div><div class=icon-image><div style="--bgimg:url('/site/gaming/consoles/items/icons/dreamcast-icon.svg');--anim:console-icon-spin 2s linear infinite"></div></div><div class=icon-box-bottom></div></div><div class=item-content><div class=content-expand><input type=checkbox id=dreamcast class=expand-checkbox>
<label for=dreamcast class=expand-label></label></div><div class=content-header>DREAMCAST</div><div class=content-detail><p>Whenever I&rsquo;d be reading a general gaming magazine (like
GamesMaster) and came across something about the Dreamcast I
always thought it looked <em>so cool</em>; even years later when
watching retrospective videos on Youtube or reading articles.
I&rsquo;d never even seen one in person though, or knew anyone that
has or had one back in the day, so when I was looking to add
to my collection and decided I was going Sega it had to be a
Dreamcast.</p><hr><ul><li>Fuse, CMOS battery and power LED.<ul><li>The fuse on the controller PCB had blown (which
apparently is quite common and can be caused by
hot-plugging controllers) so I soldered in a new
resettable one. The rechargeable CMOS battery had also
completely drained and no longer held a charge. I decided
to swap it for a battery holder (in case I ever needed to
change it again) and popped a new one in there.</li><li>I also opted to replace the orange power LED with a blue
one as the European dreamcast logo is blue and I wanted to
match them up; I&rsquo;m really pleased with how good they look
together.</li></ul></li><li>ODE<ul><li>While I still enjoy the tactile experience of popping an
honest-to-goodness official Sega approved GD-ROM disc
into the console and spinning it up to play my games,
the rarity and cost of a lot of the Dreamcast library&rsquo;s
better offerings makes it prohibitive and I&rsquo;d rather
those stay squirelled away safely in their boxes.
Replacing the GDROM drive with an optical drive emulator
lets me do just that and it&rsquo;s also handy for those pesky
region exclusives I&rsquo;d otherwise never get to play.</li></ul></li><li>Power<ul><li>The internal power supply module was working fine but
was nearly 25 years old so I replaced it with a
(genuine) PicoPSU. With the disk drive now also absent
the Dreamcast should run cooler (and safer).</li></ul></li><li>Cleaned inside and out<ul><li>Visually the Dreamcast was in great condition. All it
needed was to be stripped down and gently cleaned; I
really like the original styling of the machine and
decided to stick with it.</li></ul></li></ul><hr><p>I was going to replace the fan but the version in my Dreamcast
is a metal fan mounted to the baseplate which would require
cutting to fit the new one which I wasn&rsquo;t willing to do;
Instead I opted to clean and re-lubricate the existing fan.</p><div class=detail-thumbbar><a href=/site/gaming/consoles/items/photos/dc-front.jpg target=_blank class="thumbbar-thumb lazyload" style="--lazybg:url('/site/gaming/consoles/items/photos/thumbs/dc-front-thumb.png');--lazycol:#99AAAA55"></a><a href=/site/gaming/consoles/items/photos/dc-back.jpg target=_blank class="thumbbar-thumb lazyload" style="--lazybg:url('/site/gaming/consoles/items/photos/thumbs/dc-back-thumb.png');--lazycol:#99AAAA55"></a><a href=/site/gaming/consoles/items/photos/dc-inside.jpg target=_blank class="thumbbar-thumb lazyload" style="--lazybg:url('/site/gaming/consoles/items/photos/thumbs/dc-inside-thumb.png');--lazycol:#99AAAA55"></a><a href=/site/gaming/consoles/items/photos/dc-led.jpg target=_blank class="thumbbar-thumb lazyload" style="--lazybg:url('/site/gaming/consoles/items/photos/thumbs/dc-led-thumb.png');--lazycol:#99AAAA55"></a></div></div></div></div><div class=list-item><div class=item-icon><div class=icon-box-top></div><div class=icon-image><div style="--bgimg:url('/site/gaming/consoles/items/icons/n64-icon.svg');--anim:none"></div></div><div class=icon-box-bottom></div></div><div class=item-content><div class=content-expand><input type=checkbox id=n64 class=expand-checkbox>
<label for=n64 class=expand-label></label></div><div class=content-header>N64</div><div class=content-detail><p>We never had a Nintendo 64 in the household when I was younger
so the only time I ever got to play was at friends&rsquo; houses.
Of course, these were always multiplayer sessions usually
involving a few of us which definitely skewed my perception of
the console. Even so, there are a ton of great single-player
games most of which are well-known classics (most I&rsquo;d already
played as a re-release on a later platform, some I&rsquo;d only seen
played or heard of).</p><p><em>Super Smash Bros. was an especial treat when we first played,
mostly due to the fact you could control Pokémon (Pikachu and
Jigglypuff) directly which was super cool. I remember when the
first blurry screenshots of Pokémon Stadium appeared in the
gaming magazines, and our little minds puzzled at what it was,
this is what I was imagining it played like. WCW/nWo Revenge
was also an absolute 4-player blast.</em></p><hr><ul><li>HDMI Mod<ul><li>I&rsquo;m not blown away by the output, and would rather have
something I could run through my OSSC, and will probably
replace it with an RGB mod <em>(I did try to install one a
while back when I was just starting out and messed
it up, but have since done much more involved mods and
feel a lot more comfortable now).</em></li></ul></li><li>Shell<ul><li>The N64 was in decent condition overall and only needed a
gentle clean, but the grey shell was scuffed and tired so
I swapped it for an unofficial
<em style=color:#9559da>Atomic Purple</em>
replacement. I&rsquo;m really impressed with the look and feel
of the aftermarket shell, but opted to mix in some of the
stock shell to create a two-tone look and add a little more
individuality while keeping a bit of the original identity;
I also kept the original fixings for some extra contrast.</li></ul></li></ul><hr><p>For the controller setup I use a BlueRetro adapter — paired with
an official N64 Controller for Switch — which comes with 4 virtual
Controller Paks for saves (which can be easily backed up and
restored if needed), and allows easy switching to the built-in
Rumble Pak via a button press.</p><div class=detail-thumbbar><a href=/site/gaming/consoles/items/photos/n64-front.jpg target=_blank class="thumbbar-thumb lazyload" style="--lazybg:url('/site/gaming/consoles/items/photos/thumbs/n64-front-thumb.png');--lazycol:#99AAAA55"></a><a href=/site/gaming/consoles/items/photos/n64-back.jpg target=_blank class="thumbbar-thumb lazyload" style="--lazybg:url('/site/gaming/consoles/items/photos/thumbs/n64-back-thumb.png');--lazycol:#99AAAA55"></a><a href=/site/gaming/consoles/items/photos/n64-hdmi.jpg target=_blank class="thumbbar-thumb lazyload" style="--lazybg:url('/site/gaming/consoles/items/photos/thumbs/n64-hdmi-thumb.png');--lazycol:#99AAAA55"></a><a href=/site/gaming/consoles/items/photos/n64-hdmi-long.jpg target=_blank class="thumbbar-thumb lazyload" style="--lazybg:url('/site/gaming/consoles/items/photos/thumbs/n64-hdmi-long-thumb.png');--lazycol:#99AAAA55"></a><a href=/site/gaming/consoles/items/photos/n64-reality.jpg target=_blank class="thumbbar-thumb lazyload" style="--lazybg:url('/site/gaming/consoles/items/photos/thumbs/n64-reality-thumb.png');--lazycol:#99AAAA55"></a><a href=/site/gaming/consoles/items/photos/n64-pif.jpg target=_blank class="thumbbar-thumb lazyload" style="--lazybg:url('/site/gaming/consoles/items/photos/thumbs/n64-pif-thumb.png');--lazycol:#99AAAA55"></a></div></div></div></div><div class=list-item><div class=item-icon><div class=icon-box-top></div><div class=icon-image><div style="--bgimg:url('/site/gaming/consoles/items/icons/ps2-icon.svg');--anim:none"></div></div><div class=icon-box-bottom></div></div><div class=item-content><div class=content-expand><input type=checkbox id=ps2 class=expand-checkbox>
<label for=ps2 class=expand-label></label></div><div class=content-header>PS2</div><div class=content-detail><p>This is my childhood PS2 which I got for Christmas a
couple of years after release, so around 2002. I played the
pants off this guy until he was put away several years later,
on Christmas 2006, when I moved on to the 7th generation of home
consoles (he did resurface from time to time, mostly to play
Romance of the Three Kingdoms VIII).</p><hr><ul><li>Network Adapter (w/ SATA Mod) and HDD<ul><li>Upon powering up for the first time in an age, I found the
disk drive wasn&rsquo;t reading disks and sounded a bit grumpy. I
decided I wanted to install a hard disk drive to protect both it
and my original disks.</li><li>Originally I went with an aftermarket network adapter as
it was more readily available and seemed like it would be a lot
less work (and money) to get working. Unfortunately (unbeknownst
to me at the time) some of the pins in the adapter bent when it
was inserted and must have caused a short which (thankfully) only
popped 2 fuses.</li><li>After replacing the fuses, I opted for an official network adapter
modded with a SATA upgrade. I never had much interest in the network
conectivity initially (which isn&rsquo;t available on the aftermarket
adapters) but now I&rsquo;m very glad to have it. While the transfer
speeds are not quick — if you&rsquo;re looking to transfer a lot of large
files at once you&rsquo;d be better off connecting the HDD directly —
the utility of not having to disconnect everything to hook it up
to a PC each time is incredibly convenient; you can even backup
and restore memory cards quickly and easily. <em>(I also don&rsquo;t like
the idea of removing and inserting the adapter over and over as
there is slight damage on the port, possibly from the aftermarket
adapter.)</em></li></ul></li><li>Power Supply<ul><li>I swapped the PSU out for a RePS2 which offloads most of the
work to a good quality, external and modern AC/DC adapter.</li></ul></li><li>Big ol&rsquo; clean<ul><li>When I (eventually) popped open the case for the first time
the inside was triple-coated in a <em>generous</em> layer of
dust, especially around the vents and fans.</li><li>Since I already had it apart I also disassembled the disk drive
for a proper clean, then re-greased the rails and gears which brought
it back to life.</li></ul></li></ul><hr><p>This model of PS2 has a thin ribbon cable attached to the power and eject
buttons (which are attached to the top half of the case), ducking,
diving, and dodging until it attaches to a connector
on the main board (which is attached to the bottom half of the
case). It was an <em>absolute delight</em> dealing with this every time I
had to re-open the console, and eventually it had snagged enough
to tear very slightly at one end.</p><p>Before resorting to hunting down a suitable replacement I wanted to
attempt a fix: I carefully scratched off the insulating layer just
below the tear, exposing the traces underneath. I then trimmed
just above those, creating a nice straight edge. Finally, I transferred
the hard, blue, plastic backing from the off-cut to the new end and
carefully pushed it back into the connector (after testing for
continuity between each end of the cable with a multimeter).</p><p>Thankfully everything is working perfectly again but I would be
very hesitant to ever remove it, or even re-open the shell
(especially as the cable is now shorter than it was).</p><div class=detail-thumbbar><a href=/site/gaming/consoles/items/photos/ps2-tall.jpg target=_blank class="thumbbar-thumb lazyload" style="--lazybg:url('/site/gaming/consoles/items/photos/thumbs/ps2-tall-thumb.png');--lazycol:#99AAAA55"></a><a href=/site/gaming/consoles/items/photos/ps2-front.jpg target=_blank class="thumbbar-thumb lazyload" style="--lazybg:url('/site/gaming/consoles/items/photos/thumbs/ps2-front-thumb.png');--lazycol:#99AAAA55"></a><a href=/site/gaming/consoles/items/photos/ps2-back.jpg target=_blank class="thumbbar-thumb lazyload" style="--lazybg:url('/site/gaming/consoles/items/photos/thumbs/ps2-back-thumb.png');--lazycol:#99AAAA55"></a><a href=/site/gaming/consoles/items/photos/ps2-psu.jpg target=_blank class="thumbbar-thumb lazyload" style="--lazybg:url('/site/gaming/consoles/items/photos/thumbs/ps2-psu-thumb.png');--lazycol:#99AAAA55"></a><a href=/site/gaming/consoles/items/photos/ps2-psu-back.jpg target=_blank class="thumbbar-thumb lazyload" style="--lazybg:url('/site/gaming/consoles/items/photos/thumbs/ps2-psu-back-thumb.png');--lazycol:#99AAAA55"></a><a href=/site/gaming/consoles/items/photos/ps2-fuses.jpg target=_blank class="thumbbar-thumb lazyload" style="--lazybg:url('/site/gaming/consoles/items/photos/thumbs/ps2-fuses-thumb.png');--lazycol:#99AAAA55"></a></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><footer class=footer><div id=footer-large>Site and content created by Iain Crawford
